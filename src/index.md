# Hello!

I am software engineer on the data team at HCG Fund Management developing data intensive, user-friendly, and feature-rich software. My personal time is spent either exploring the mountains of Colorado or dreaming up technical solutions to backcountry safety.

This site is a collection of my personal notes.
