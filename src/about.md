I'm a software engineer living in Denver, Colorado who currently works on the data team at HCG Fund Management.

I earned my Bachelor's degree in Software Engineering from the University of Northern Colorado where I also conducted university funded research on the use of autonomous drones in wildfire mitigation - specifically communication among drone clusters.

When not coding, you'll find me exploring the Colorado mountains on skis and bikes with my partner and our dog Juneau, or thinking up ways to enhance backcountry safety through technology.
